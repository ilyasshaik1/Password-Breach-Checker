# 🔐 Password Breach Checker (Flask Web App)

A Flask-based web application to check if a password has appeared in known data breaches, using the **Have I Been Pwned** API.  
It uses the k-Anonymity model to protect your privacy — your full password is **never** sent over the internet.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Check if a password has been compromised in data breaches.
- ✅ Uses secure k-Anonymity method (only first 5 hash characters sent).
- 💻 Simple and responsive UI built with Bootstrap.
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — runs locally.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a password into the form.
2. The password is converted into a SHA-1 hash locally.
3. Only the **first 5 characters** of the hash are sent to the Have I Been Pwned API.
4. API returns possible matching hashes; the app checks locally if the password exists in the list.
5. Result is displayed without exposing the password.

## 📜 Example

**Input:**

```
mypassword123
```

**Output:**

```
⚠️ This password was found 120394 times. Change it!
```

## 🔒 Privacy Note

Your password is **never sent** in plain text or in full hash form — this ensures maximum privacy and security.
